## Helgen's thoughts

I woke up in the wood again this morning. For a brief moment I thought it a morning from another life. I am becoming too accustomed to the town. Out here all I have missed is clear to see. The sound of branches in the wind, game in the brush, birds in the trees. 

Alas, this is not the Grove. Our camp was ambushed by an ogre, the second we've encountered near town in recent days. The hide of this one was marked like the first. The runes are unfamiliar to me. While my knowledge of ogres is not great, I do not believe them to be ranging, solitary creatures. To me it seems that something external to themselves is driving this change. I feel ill at ease.

I am working alone a lot less of late. For this task, I am again accompanied by Shale, as well as Rikket, a traveller from distant lands. They are as different to each other as stone to sap. Yet they would both do well here if they chose to stay. Mirrin's Gate is changing, it needs outsiders, especially ones such as these. If not, it would surely become yet another overgrown ruin in the vast wode, despite my efforts.

I say they are strange, but to them I must seem so as well! I fear that sight of my inside ropes unmanned Shale a little. He turned as white as the roots in Farmer Corwell's field! Although, credit where it's due, he handled his Mushroom innards like a seasoned woodsman. Rikkit, I struggle to comprehend. He seems to use a magic far from my understanding, and boasts a very large tug number (six!). Though I can't fault his commitment to the task we agreed to carry out together, I can certainly see the value he would bring, were he to linger here a while.

Between the three of us we got back in the same three pieces in which we left and the apothecary will be well stocked for some time. Tonight the wind is singing the song of the wood, but I must confess I'm looking forward to a pint of cool ale and the company of my new companions in the Mirrin's Gate tavern.
