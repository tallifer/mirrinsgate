## Stonejaw's Tavern Tale

Hello, my dear friends. I am a storyteller of questionable renown, and today I find myself interpreting the grunts of an old man. Throughout my many years of travel, I have encountered all manner of brooding warriors and silent types, but Stone Jaw… well, he might have been hit in the face one too many times, or perhaps his silence hides something deeper.

Regardless, I have taken it upon myself to translate his unique form of communication. What follows is my humble attempt to make sense of his… loquacity.

**Grunt: Despite my deep dislike for the girl, I was roped into a rescue mission.**

Stone Jaw is not one for dialogue, but somehow, in the middle of a group of overly chatty adventurers, the village and his sense of duty chose him. First, they ventured into a forest glade with a magical pool, full of colour and life. Horrible. There were no proper enemies, no clashes of steel — just the voices of whispering spirits, and annoying optimism. His associates seemed incapable of a proper brawl and required rescuing from a pond.

**Grunt: Once we were out of the forest, we reached a much filthier place. Still dull.**

Stone Jaw missed the hard stone of mountain paths and the cold echo of caves. But the gods of war are not deaf. His prayers were heard.

**Grunt: In the heart of the swamp we faced an an ogre. The dwarf, the one with some fight in him, lent a hand. It was glorious. The beardy druid hid. Naturally... Ah. Right. And we saved the little girl.**

And that, my friends, is the tale…for now. Stone Jaw says little, but in his silence, there is truth. Or perhaps just grunting. Either way, I’ll be here to translate.
