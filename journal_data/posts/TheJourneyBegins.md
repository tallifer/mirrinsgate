Welcome to Mirrin's Gate

# Campaign Rules

### The Campaign Structure:
- **System:** Pathfinder, 2E.
-  We follow a West-Marches style narrative.
- You are an adventurer because you feel a strong call in your bones to adventure. The boredom of a calm life doesn't appeal to you â€“ you are driven to leave behind the safety of civilization and explore the wilds to make your name. Regardless of what drives you, you are driven. 
-  Mirrin's Gate is always 'safe' for players, and adventures occur outside of Mirrin's Gate. This is done to avoid 'town' adventures. 
-  The wilds outside of Mirrin's gate are not safe.
-  80% of all loot goes to Sam's Character.

### Roll for DM:
Following a 2-4 session adventure, the party must role a **d4** to determine the next DM according to this table:

|DM | Assigned Number |
|:----:|:-|
| Sam | 1 |
| Will  | 2 |
| Peter | 3 |
| Fergus |4 |


### Map making:
- Players work together to fill in the 'quick-edit' map as best they can. [Click me to access the rough map.](https://lucid.app/lucidspark/be45bc95-a2eb-4069-af7c-001337685a57/edit?viewport_loc=-2036%2C-780%2C5184%2C2733%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_cf24baf7-2b0e-447b-9755-893ce9ef40ed
)
- The map can be updated to reflect new knowledge. 
- The main map is made in Inkarnate: [Click here.](https://inkarnate.com/m/g2bELj)
- As a DM, plan for us to explore areas of the map which can be represented with a portrait-aspect-ratio (for ease of viewing in this doc).

### Recording progress:
- Each 2-4 session adventure arc should be recorded on an individual page.
- For each session within the arc, an individual party character adds a 'log entry' to the 'journal', which is this book. I think we're aiming to tell a story through our characters, one which we really enjoy re-reading. 


### Mysteries and unknowns:
##### Rules concerning unknowns 

- **Rule 1:** There can be no more than 10 unknowns.
- **Rule 2:** You may add a single unknown per 4-session adventure.
- **Rule 3:** Once you 'solve' an unknown, remove it from the list.
- **Rule 4:** An individual unknown may not occupy more than a single line.


##### Time to Drop Knowledge
**Unknown 1:** The ogre from 'First Steps' had some bound hide with runes written on it. Language unknown.  
**Unknown 2:**
