# Rikkit

There are no clocks in the desert. Time is told using the sun and stars, and most folk don't pay particular attention. That has never been an option for Rikkit. Most would have been driven mad by the sound of falling sand and ticking clocks; they would have stopped their ears in vain or drank themselves into a stupor. Rikkit did none of those things, Rikkit listened. 

### Tick Tock Goes the Clock
For as long as he can remember, Rikkit has heard the ticking of the universal clock. He doesn't quite know how long that's been though. The more he listens, the more disconnected he becomes with the linear time experienced by others. How old he is is a meaningless question. He is here now, or at least he can convince others that he is. What really is the difference?

### Desert Rat
Conditions in the deep desert do not lend themselves well to life, and a folk must be hardy to survive there. They must have deep knowledge of the shifting currents of the sands and be ever on the move to track down water and food. Unity and clarity of purpose are required for such a society. All traits found in abundance in the Ysoki as a whole. All traits for which Rikkit has no aptitude whatsoever. The clans looked after him well enough, but it was clear he wasn't carrying his weight. Of course, not everyone has to. The old and the infirm can contribute in other ways. Those ways do not necessarily include cryptic warnings of future (or potentially past) events happening in distance lands. It was best for Rikkit to leave when he did.
