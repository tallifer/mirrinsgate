## Shale Writes

Today, I finihsed questing through the southern range of peaks. Today, I descended their rugged slopes, and arrived in Mirrin's Gate.

I can see why it's named as such. When looking down upon the wilds and their infinite sprawl, one outpost stands before them, a metaphorical gate through which all must travel in order to uncover their secrets.

Thoth undoubletly knows good sense in bringing me here, and yet, I feel as if the townsfolk would benifit less from a professionally made Altar, and more from a pallisade wall facing the dark forest to the north-west.

Indeed, within hours of arriving, a child not old enough to work the bellows was taken. A forest man, Helgen, believes it to be an Ogre, and will persue. I am happy to join him, for am I not here to delve into these lands and find what is hidden? A third runs with us. Stonejaw. Kin of mine, he is, but a red gleam of death and fury lurks in his eye. I know not if he hates himself, or the world around him. He will taste my stew, and we shall see if he can't tell us a tale or two.
