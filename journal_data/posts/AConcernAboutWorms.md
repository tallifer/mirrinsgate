## Rikkit Writes

Oh these blasted feet of mine, aching they are as though I haven't walked for days on end - and yet I have. I suspect their pain is a reflection of the tiresome company I've endured over the last while. Well, I suppose they're fine company. Adequate. One is completely befuddled by his god of knowledge and the other thinks that time is a _stream_. Still, I've had worse.

Now, what have I been up to? Ah yes, the road has brought me to what passes for a town this far south. A small collection of buildings at the foot of the mountains I've seen in the distance the last while. The locals asked me if I was a preacher, so I had a go at that - didn't care for it. Decent tavern, surprisingly good choice of spirits to ease the aforementioned issues with my drinking companions. 

Currently however, I'm not in the tavern. ~I'm~ We're in a forest, big one at that. We've just killed an ogre, mean looking bastard, and now we're having a sit down. Not quite sure why we're here, but it's nice to stretch out the magical muscles once in a while.
