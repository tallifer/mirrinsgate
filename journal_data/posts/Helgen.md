# Helgen - the last leaf

Born in the shadow of Mirin’s Gate, Helgen was raised on hard labour, harder winters, and the whispered tales of the wild beyond the walls. Life was simple, brutal, and bound to the land. As the town pushed deeper into the unknown, he was swept up in its expansion, conscripted into the militia, armed with a crossbow, and taught to survive.

He fought tooth and nail against the wild things beyond the treeline: wolves, bandits, and worse. But with each campaign, the forest reclaimed all they won.

## Breaking
On a doomed expedition beyond the known trails, his unit was scattered. Whether by storm, beast, or some deeper power, only Helgen remained. Wounded and lost, he wandered through ancient woods until he collapsed beneath a ring of moss-covered stones.

There, hidden beneath the canopy, he was healed body and spirit. They, of old stone and deep root, the druids spoke with the wind, danced with beasts, and taught him of The Balance. 

## Grove
Helgen shed the skin of a soldier. Under the moonlight, he was initiated into the ancient rites. The seasons marked his time. Nature itself seemed to claim him, his aging slowed, his senses sharpened, and a deep, restless power rooted in his soul.

Alas, paradise is never permanent. Something dark crept into the forest, twisted and hungering. One by one, the druids fell. The grove withered. He fled, guilt gnawing at his heels, a wild wind chasing his feet.

## Return
When Helgen staggered back to Mirin’s Gate, years had passed. He was older, but not as old as he should be. To the townsfolk, he became something between a stray beast and a local priest. Some feared him. Others sought him for healing, for guidance, for the old ways. Children left flowers at his door. Farmers asked for blessings on their fields. 

They call him Greenfather now, Wild Man,

*the Last Leaf*.


## A Storm Gathering
Walking between two worlds: civilisation and wilderness, memory and instinct. Helgen knows something still stirs in the deep woods, the same rot that claimed his grove. He dreams of twisted roots, of teeth and shadow. But for now, he waits. He watches. He teaches. He defends

*And when the woods call again… he will answer.*
