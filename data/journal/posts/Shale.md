# Shale - Cleric of Thoth

Born in the foothills north of Celebon, Shale’s first steps into the overworld bore him a sight of sunwashed lowlands, and a great city perched on the edge of a pit of cut, black, stone. From that pit rose the beginnings of a great tower, the shadow of which cast across the land and held all in its grip.

Shale gripped his axe. He clutched his cookware. Then, he applied for a job.

The tower was the perfect opportunity for a chipper young Dwarf like Shale; it required a large labour-force, a great deal of blacksmithing, and it provided hands on experience in occult building practices.

Shale was welcomed with open arms. True, those arms often contained the occasional red, glowing, flail, and his some of his colleague seemed to disappear for ‘work 

assignments’, but this detail was drowned in the wonders that he wrought. Shale delved into macro-runic-architecture, he wove mana-channelling-corridor-webs and finally, he learnt of the holy-harmonies, an art of stone weaving and metal binding to create an alter capable of bringing forth the intent and presence of a deity.

He built his harmony in secret, lost in the tower’s tangle. It whispered forth, and was just barely heard by Thoth. Thoth of Innovation. Thoth of Knowledge.

Thoth approved, and struck a deal with Shale… **“Escape this foul den. Venture forth into the wilds, and seek the ancient mysteries. Find the forgotten holy-harmonies and study their secrets. Learn, and then to build me an altar at the threshold of man’s exploration. Go to Mirin’s Gate, and help them Know…”**
