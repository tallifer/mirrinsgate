# Stonejaw - The Hammer

He came to Mirin's Gate with a hammer, a broken name, and no interest in telling his story. Stonejaw works the walls. Drinks alone. Sleeps light. They say he doesn't plray, but watches the mountains like they might hold an answer to his unspoken questions.

Few know his name. Fewer ask.

Many came to Mirin’s Gate hiding something. No one asks questions. As long as you don’t cause trouble, the town lets you rot in peace. If you want community, you can find it. But the townsfolk know when to leave a man alone. Especially the ones who longs for it.

When the bell rings, Stonejaw is already moving. No words. No mercy. Just the sound of steel and the fury of a dwarf suffering. He paints the earth with the colour of his eyes: red. When the blood dries, it matches his skin and armour: dark, weathered, ___.


Once, a child saw him from the high walls, hammering at a boulder that would not break. Blow after blow. No enemy in sight. Just him. Fighting the stone. The child said he was crying.
But the tears weren’t for weakness.
They were **for still not being strong enough**
